## PuzzleBot Mobile Robotics Project

This project focuses on introducing mobile robotics concepts using the PuzzleBot, a robot developed by Manchester Robotics and NVIDIA. The project integrates essential robotics components and software to explore mobile robotics fundamentals with ROS (Robot Operating System).

### Hardware Requirements

- NVIDIA Jetson Nano
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- Quadrature Motors (2 units)
- Acrylic Chassis (modular robot armable)

### Software Requirements

- ROS (Robot Operating System) for robot control and programming.
- Jetson Nano SDK for hardware integration and management.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Assemble the Hardware:**
   - Construct the PuzzleBot using the acrylic chassis, mount the motors, and connect the Raspberry Pi camera.
   - Attach the Jetson Nano to the chassis and wire it to the motors and camera.

2. **Install ROS on Jetson Nano:**
   - Follow the instructions provided by NVIDIA to install ROS on the Jetson Nano.

3. **Configure the PuzzleBot:**
   - Load the provided ROS packages and configure them for motor control, camera input, and navigation tasks.

4. **Run the Robot:**
   - Start the ROS nodes to initiate the PuzzleBot's operations and verify its functionality.

### Applications

- **Mobile Navigation:** Explore basic navigation techniques and obstacle avoidance.
- **Sensor Integration:** Learn about integrating cameras and encoders with ROS.
- **Robot Programming:** Develop and test ROS nodes for controlling mobile robots.
